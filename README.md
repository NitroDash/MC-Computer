# MC-Computer
An 8-bit, 83mHz computer in Minecraft.

This repo is the raw save data of the Minecraft world with the computer; to view just download it and put it in your .minecraft/saves folder, which contains all of your worlds. I think it will only work with the Java Edition, not the Bedrock Edition (also known as "Windows 10 Edition"). If your title screen says "Minecraft: Java Edition" you're fine.

The computer has 16 bytes of RAM and a control panel with room for 16 lines of machine code. It comes pre-loaded with a program that calculates the first ten Fibonacci numbers.

It has arithmetic operations for addition, subtraction, bit shifting, and various bitwise operations. It also has jumps, conditional and unconditional. More detailed instructions can be found in a manual in-game.
